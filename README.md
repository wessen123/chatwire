# Chatwire

Chatwire is a clone of ChatGPT made with Laravel Breeze using Livewire and the OpenAI PHP client (Chat and Audio Resource). It also supports a command interface for asking questions to ChatGPT using Laravel Prompts.

## Description

In this project, we have a Laravel 10 Breeze with Livewire, a login session, and access to OpenAI's ChatGPT API. The entire Laravel project is based on TailwindCSS using Flowbite, Vite.js to compile scripts, MySQL. As far as the extra packages Flowbite, Laravel-Livewire, openai-php, livewire-alert, Laravel Prompts are used.
